# Obsidian MathQuill Plugin
I love the speed and ease of typing math in Desmos. Desmos uses a service called [MathQuill](mathquill.com), so this is a plugin to bring MathQuill into Obsidian.

### NOTE:

As of right now, I'm not sure that this is possible. MathQuill was built for webapps, and Obsidian doesn't play nicely with certain DOM elements (also I am not a JavaScript developer). Therefore, this project is currently retired. If you have any suggestions or you know how to overcome these issues, please let me know.
